It was bound to happen (again) sooner or later.

A number of times when I was young and the Internet as we know it was not generally accessible, I took a couple of swings as a broke kid at trying to keep houseplants. I had no mentors. I wasn't finding great books at the library on the subject. So I tried and failed to keep houseplants alive.

Back then I knew nothing of repotting, fertilizing, or the dangers of over watering. To say nothing of tiny pests like spider mites.

This turned me off to the idea of keeping plants again for most of my life. That is, until my kids got into it and started *not* killing plants themselves.

Ok, there was new information here, and I had to know what they learned.

They got me pointed in the right direction this year. And I have to say... I'm applying a bit of that *neurodivergent enthusiasm* to this whole thing. What do I mean by *neurodivergent enthusiasm*? Ever know an Autistic person or ADHD person with a hobby that they can't shut up about? That's me. I'm *both* ADHD *and* Autistic so really I'm completely sucked in by this.

While I'll periodically make specific articles about houseplants, I expect to keep this one up-to-date as my collection grows. Think of this as the index. 

# The Plants

## Aglaonema

The *Aglaonemas* probably need no introduction. The *Chinese Evergreen* seems a fixture in every home of everyone who even likes houseplants a little bit. I really like these quite a lot and my family may grow to regret it as my plant collection inevitably breaks past the boundaries of my home office.

## Aglaonema 'Golden Papaya'

{{<figure src="goldenPapaya.png">}}

My first *Aglaonema*, the "Golden Papaya" stood out in a sea of Chinese Evergreen varieties... which is hard to do in such a gorgeous family of houseplants. I wonder if this might be the *Miami Vice* of houseplants.

## Alocasia

Everybody has their favorites. Right now, as I write this early in my plant hobby, the *Alocasias* are really doing it for me. The almost alien looking foliage makes my heart pitter-patter.

### Alocasia sinuata

{{<figure src="Alocasia-sinuata.png">}}

*Alocasia sinuata* is my first *Alocasia*, and definitely not my last. It's not the most overstated of the genus, to be sure. But the shiny leaves with deep texture, grading between dark green edges and light green highlights... it's not *variegated*, per se. But it comes off like something the Disney Imagineers came up with for an Avatar-themed ride at Disneyworld.

Within a week of repotting, the first pup took off.

A week later, the second began unfurling.

My kids are happy to take the pups, and through them I know this little plant will be with our family for a long time.

### Alocasia melo

{{<figure src="Alocasia-melo.png">}}

On a trip to the garden center with my kids, one of my daughters called me over to look at an *Alocasia* she'd found. She knew my tastes by this point, and knew I wouldn't be able to resist the amazing textures on the surface of this *Alocasia melo* foliage. This is one of those kinds of plants that demands to be touched. One must lay fingertips on this leaf before believing it's real.

What remains to be seen is how much dust will be a challenge with this one. Even with regular dusting using a dry paintbrush, I could see dust getting packed into the finely webbed texture on the surface of its leaves.

Immediately after bringing it home, a new leaf budded and unfurled, before I even had a chance to repot it. 

## Hoya

I confess, I'm not a *Hoya* afficianado. At least not *yet*. I appreciate them for bringing some variety to my houseplant collection. But I may appreciate them more deeply as time goes on.

### Hoya australis ‘Lisa’

{{<figure src="Hoya-australis-lisa.png">}}

This was just one of those *impulse buys*. Cute little plant sitting near a cute little pot to upgrade into. Boom. Sold.

## Orchids

As I write this, I'm still in that weird headspace where I'm believing the hype that orchids are somehow *really hard* to keep alive. But at the same time, my kitchen is full of orchids that are thriving and giving us the most gorgeous blooms (thanks to one of my daughters who owns them and cares for them).

I'm always admiring the things, and sharing this with her. And she's convinced me to give them a try.

On one trip to the garden center together, while we were admiring some large, beautiful orchids that started at 60 and rapidly went up from there... she noticed some orchids that were not blooming, that had been cut back (but were otherwise mature), and being kept underneath the table with the blooming orchids. There was a sign next to them that said "$5.99, buy one get one free".

For that price, I couldn't *not* take the risk. My daughter picked us out two promising looking dormant orchids and hopefully someday this one bounces back for me.

I'm also going to try out some of the cheap little orchids that they have at the supermarket.

## Peperomia

While *Alocasia* might be my early favorite, *Peperomias* are no slouches themselves! I'm really drawn to the amazing varieties of foliage that are exhibited by this diverse genus.

### Peperomia argyreia

{{<figure src="Peperomia-argyreia.png">}}

*Peperomia argyreia* was labeled as "watermelon peperomia" at the plant shop. Once again, one of my kids brought it to my attention. And who am I to say no when one of my girls tells me they think I'll like this plant? (they were right, though)

The leaves on this *Peperomia* really do look like the skin of a watermelon! I'm looking forward to seeing this one grow up.

### Peperomia caperata "Schumi Red"

I see these things all the time at home improvement stores. I found one at the local plant shop, and even there it was thought so little of that it didn't deserve to be named. It was labeled merely "terrarium plant".

In fact, what I have might not even be *Peperomia caperata*. I'm guessing based on google image searches. 

But in any case, those gorgeous wine-colored leaves add a nice splash of red to my growing sea of green.

## Pothos

Ok, I say the *Rhaphidophora* is where it began. But that's just where the first *potted* plant began. Months prior to that, I'd stolen off with a cutting from my daughter's ailing *Pothos* on the kitchen table. It was just a cutting itself, dropped into a small vase of water that came straight out of the tap with no fertilizers to speak of. The thing seemed more rootball than plant. So I took a pathetic little cutting off of it and clipped it to the back of one of my aquariums. The node was allowed to dip just below the surface.

In this environment, this sad little *Pothos* took off! It sent roots down into the aquarium, and quickly penetrated the dense foam of its *mattenfilter*. Once it had roots into the filter foam, with all of that *fish poop* ripe for the feasting, the *Pothos* took off! A cluster of leaves formed close to the tank, and then it started vining outward. I guided it toward the adjacent aquarium where it immediately repeated the trick of sending roots down into the *mattenfilter*. The leaves were getting larger and less pathetic looking. It kept vining out further, repeating the trick again with a third aquarium. It had grown to about 8 feet in length before I started really cutting it down. First offering a big healthy cut to my daughter that I first stole it from. Then to my other daughter who wanted a *Pothos* of her own to train to the walls of her bedroom. 

I've started a couple of fancier *Pothos* cuttings all over again (if they are even really *Pothos*).

I'm probably not going to let this plant take over like it would, if it could. I'll leave that to something that makes more of a statement.

## Rhaphidophora

### Rhaphidophora decursiva

It all began with a really big mature specimen of *Rhaphidophora decursiva*. I was taking my kids to the garden center, and this big beauty was dangling down several feet from a pot hanging rather high in the greenhouse. Though the price was rather high from what I'd have expected for a house plant, I had to have it. I had to try it out.

Temporarily, I left it in its original hanging basket sitting on a high shelf in my office, across the room from floor to ceiling east-facing windows. It never really gets any direct sunlight, but it gets a good amount of indirect sunlight. I did what my young friend *The Internet* told me, and I waited until the soil was dry from the surface down past my first knuckle. I gave it a good 250ml of water and not a drop came out the bottom of the pot. 

The next day there were new leaf tips forming, moisture dripping out of the tips. The new leaves coming out are fenestrated, groups of three. Though *The Internet* tells me this is not the final form! The vines started growing rather vigorously, and some exceed the "40 inches max" length I have been reading online. I know this because they are on the corner of a 48 inch long shelf, vine running to the opposite end of the shelf, and then running down the post of the shelf a good bit farther!

## Carnivorous Plants

### Venus Fly Traps

Many different cultivars are out there, but it's all just *Dionaea muscipula* when you get down to it. 

The Venus Fly Trap is probably one of the most heavily *killed* house plants in history. It used to be the kind of thing you mail-ordered out of the back of a comic book. But now you can find them in your local Wal-mart, usually not looking very well. And after the curious owner gives them tap water (or none at all), or perhaps feeds them a bit of ground & processed beef, they ultimately succumb.

But I'm making a go of it! I've got a little glass bowl terrarium with the **Akai Ryu** cultivar. I'm only watering it with distilled water. And I'm going to leave it to capture gnats on its own.

The terrarium has a false bottom (lava rock) and a nutrient-free substrate that's heavy on sphagnum moss, peat moss, and perlite. 

## Random

There are a few little plants I picked up that were entirely undescribed. I'll try to get their names in here when I can. Or perhaps some photos to help others tell me what the name is.

## Coffea arabica "Coffee Plant"

## Ficus pumila "Creeping Fig"

## Hemigraphis repanda "Dragon's Tongue"

## Stromanthe sanguinea "Triostar"

# The Space

My "plant room" is my home office. It's always a bit crowded and cluttered, and forgive me if I don't (yet) choose to share wide-angle photos of the space. I'm going to guess it's about 12x12 feet with 8 foot high ceilings.

The east wall has two standard-width floor-to-ceiling windows. The south wall has one floor-to-ceiling window, but because it is in the shade of some tall trees and a large neighboring house, the light from it feels a lot more like a north window. The west wall has a single width doorway (with no door) leading into the living room. And the north wall has in its center a pair of french doors opening into the foyer.

# Humidity

The office has quite a number of fish aquariums, an *indoor pond* (really a resin planter filled with water and fish... I should blog about that), a large natural terrarium with a trickling waterfall. All of these things probably help to keep the room from drying out during the winter. But it can still get down to, or below, 40% even with all of that passive aid.

I added a [Levoit 6L humidifier](https://amzn.to/3ndHhSx) to the room and leave it running full-blast, 24x7. But even then, the room dips down as low as 50% and struggles to peak at 60%. I'm continuing to use it, but more for localized humidity for the plants who really need it the most. I have to top this off once in the morning and once again in the evening.

During a visit to [Urban Pothos](https://www.urbanpothoshouseplantshopnc.com/) in downtown Raleigh, I was admiring a fairly massive floor-standing humidifier and half jokingly told the clerk "that looks like what I need". And she said "you should absolutely get one; they set you back a little over 200 bucks but they are so worth it". They don't sell these units at the store so she was just giving me good solid advice about what's working for her in her own home.

I checked out the unit in the store and it was a [5.5 gallon Lacidoll commercial humidifier](https://amzn.to/3QC8OdU). The reviews were quite good. And even though it's a big spend, and a big thing to put in my home office, I'd really like to make sure my office has the idea humidity for the plants that I'm keeping (to say nothing of the pet geckos).
